Student project of generating digital terrain models using OpenGL

Application written in Delphi 7 - allows you to prepare a digital terrain model based on a physical map scan. The entire project consists of 3 applications for generating a digital model, area analysis already on the digital map and applications for 3D visualization using OpenGL.

To prepare the correct digital terrain model it is best to use physical map scans with as few subtitles, comments, etc. The application allows you to calibrate the recognition of physical map colors, but the subtitles themselves will be a problem. Exemplary physical maps can be found as attached files to the project.
